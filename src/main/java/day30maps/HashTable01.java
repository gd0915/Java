    /*

        1)Hashtable is a Map
        2)Hashtable does not put entries to any order(Therefore, HashTable fast but slower than HashMaps)
        3)Hashtable is slower than HashMap
        4)Hashtable is thread-safe(You can use HashTable structure in multi-thread operations) and synchronized
          (Java does the multiple tasks simultaneously)
           To create sensible order to be able to complete the multiple thread is called synchronization.
           Thread-safe:  If a structure is possible to be used in multi-thread(multitask) operations, that structure is called thread-safe.
           Synchronized: To create sensible order for multi-thread, it is called synchronization. Java gives you some methods to create synchronization.
           Java gives you some methods to create threads which are available for multi-threads.

        Note: Hashtable does not accept "null" neither in "key"s nor in "values"

        Note: HashMaps cannot be used in multi-thread, but HashTables is thread safe and synchronized.
