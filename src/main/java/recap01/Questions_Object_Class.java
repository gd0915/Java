    Difference between Object and Class?

    Class is a blueprint or template which you can create as many objects as you like Object is a member or instance of a class.
    Class is declared using class keyword, Object is created through new keyword mainly.
    A class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value.
    A class also describes object behavior.
    An object is a member or an "instance" of a class and has states and behaviors
    in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.
    Class - A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.
    If we compare them there are many differences but let me tell you some of them which are important to know;
    There are many ways to create object in java such as new keyword, newInstance() method, clone() method, factory
    method and deserialization.
    There is only one way to define class in java using class keyword.
    Object is created many times as per requirement. Class is declared once.
    Object is an instance of a class. Class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created.
    Object is a physical entity. Class is a logical entity.

        throw new IOException("Unable to shutdown");
    }

    For Example:
    Class: Human Object: Man, Woman Class: Mobile phone Object: iPhone, Samsung, Moto
    Class: Fruit Object: Apple, Banana, Mango, Guava Class: Food Object: Pizza, Burger, Samosa
