    OVERLOADING
1.	If you create a method with the same name and different parameters,it means you are doing Method Overloading.
2.	Method Overloading happens in a single class, therefore we do not need “INHERITANCE” for this method.
3.	To do Method Overloading :

a.	Don’t change the method name;
b.	Change the parameters by changing the:

i)	number of parameters
ii)	data type of the parameters
iii)	places of the parameters (to use this option data types of the parameters  must be different
4.	“private” methods can be overloaded.
5.	 “final” methods can be overloaded.
6.	“static” methods can be overloaded.

*Question:
                   Why do we need Method Overloading?
Answer:
                   It allows using the same method name multiple times without creating again
                   and again in the same class. The advantage of Method Overloading is that
                   it increases code readability and maintainability.

*Question:
                  Can a main() method be overloaded?
 Answer:
                  Yes. Overloaded main method has to be called from inside the
                 “public static void main (String args[])”  as this is the entry point when the class is
                  launched.

Note:
              STATIC POLYMORPHISM == COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM is another name for Method Overloading
